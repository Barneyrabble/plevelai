# Status Checkpoint — 2024-10-08 (late evening)

## What Works Right Now
- Laser TTL is safe and predictable: the sketch boots inactive, honors a 500 ms pulse, and exposes runtime polarity/pulse controls via `config`.
- Host launcher throttles serial traffic (default 0.2 s between sends) and only enqueues higher-confidence detections, so the queue drains and the laser pulses exactly once per command.
- Pan motion is healthy after reseating the cable; the controller homes automatically and re-uses cached calibration values.
- Latest firmware snapshot saved to `docs/firmware_snapshots/nano_r4_2024-10-08.ino` for quick rollback.

## Outstanding / To Investigate
1. **Tilt travel is still short** – it jolts ~10° then rebounds. Suspect steps/deg calibration or mechanical backlash. Use the new runtime config to experiment with tilt scaling.
   - Example: `echo '{"cmd":"config","axis":{"tilt":{"steps_per_deg":35.0}}}' > /dev/ttyACM0`
   - Remember: any axis tweak forces a re-home and clears the motion queue.
2. **Target firehose** – throttling helps, but the camera still produces lots of detections. Consider bumping the confidence gate in `launch` further (`SERIAL_SEND_INTERVAL` env var + `--conf 0.65`).
3. **YOLO shutdown** – runs until you ^C; the exception spam on exit is harmless but noisy. Optionally wrap `launch` with graceful teardown if it becomes annoying.

## Next Session Checklist
- Run `launch` (optionally `SERIAL_SEND_INTERVAL=0.15 launch`) and watch `CTRL:` logs to confirm tilt calibration adjustments take effect.
- Tune `axis.tilt.steps_per_deg` until physical travel matches commanded motion; note final value in this file once satisfied.
- Verify pan/tilt both re-home cleanly after any config changes.
- If time allows, script a calibration sweep (e.g., step through 0 → 90 deg tilt) to capture actual motion vs. command.

## Quick Commands
- `launch` → YOLO + serial loop with throttling (set `SERIAL_SEND_INTERVAL` env var to tweak cadence).
- Manual config poke: `echo '{"cmd":"config","axis":{"reset":true}}' > /dev/ttyACM0` to revert axis gains.
- Re-upload sketch: `arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:renesas_uno:unor4wifi control/arduino/nano_r4` then `arduino-cli upload --fqbn arduino:renesas_uno:unor4wifi --port /dev/ttyACM0 control/arduino/nano_r4`.
- View firmware snapshot: `docs/firmware_snapshots/nano_r4_2024-10-08.ino` (identical to what’s on the board).

**Note:** Leave the rig powered but idle after closing `launch`; the controller stays in a known state and will auto-home once a new session starts.
