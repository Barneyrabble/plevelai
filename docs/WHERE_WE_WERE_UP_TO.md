# Status Checkpoint — 2024-10-13 (late evening)

The DM556 drivers and the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi now share a clean logic reference, and the production firmware has been reloaded with DM556-safe timing (15 microsecond step pulses + 20 microsecond DIR settle) while retaining the motion queue, homing logic, and laser gating.

## System configuration: DM556 drivers + Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
- PSU V+ -> DM556 +V
- PSU COM -> DM556 GND
- PSU COM <-> Arduino GND (shared reference)
- Arduino GND -> blue rail on the breadboard (shared logic ground for PSU and both drivers)
- Arduino 5 V pin -> red rail on the breadboard (shared +5 V logic reference)
- Red rail feeds: both drivers' PUL+, DIR+, (optional) ENA+
- PAN driver returns: PUL- -> Arduino D2 (STEP), DIR- -> Arduino D3 (DIR), ENA floating
- TILT driver returns: PUL- -> Arduino D5 (STEP), DIR- -> Arduino D6 (DIR), ENA floating

### Breadboard rails summary

| Breadboard Rail | Signal       | Connected Components                        |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Red (+)         | +5 V logic   | Arduino 5 V, all PUL+, DIR+, ENA+           |
| Blue (-)        | Ground / COM | Arduino GND, PSU COM, all PUL-/DIR- returns |

## Firmware changes (UNO R4 DM556 controller)
- Pulse timing fixed at 15 microsecond STEP high/low with a 20 microsecond DIR settle, satisfying DM556 requirements.
- Default steps-per-degree now use the 3200 pulses/rev DIP setting (≈8.89 steps/deg); adjust over JSON `config` if calibration drifts.
- `motors_check` command sweeps pan/tilt and fires the laser twice so demos run even without the Jetson runtime.
- Working snapshot saved at `control/arduino/nano_r4/working_sketch_2025-10-15.ino` for quick rollback.

Key excerpts for quick reference:
```cpp
constexpr float PAN_STEPS_PER_DEG  = 3200.0f / 360.0f;
constexpr float TILT_STEPS_PER_DEG = 3200.0f / 360.0f;
constexpr uint16_t STEP_PULSE_HIGH_US = 15;
constexpr uint16_t STEP_PULSE_LOW_US  = 15;
constexpr uint16_t DIR_SETUP_DELAY_US = 20;
```
### Expected results
- Both DM556 drivers show PWR solid, ALM off.
- Each motor holds torque once the drivers are powered and the controller completes homing.
- Commands from the runtime land smoothly; DM556 drivers now see 15 microsecond pulses with 20 microsecond direction settle so there are no missed steps at the configured speeds.

### Troubleshooting checklist
1. Measure between red and blue rails (~5.0 V expected).
2. Verify continuity between blue rail and PSU COM (0 ohms).
3. If motors hold but do not step, confirm driver microstep DIP (target 3200 pulses/rev) and probe the STEP pins for pulses.

## Next session checklist
- Upload the refreshed firmware (`control/arduino/nano_r4/nano_r4.ino`) and let it auto-home; verify telemetry reflects DM556 timing constants.
- Kick off `MODEL=vision/models/best.pt ./launch` on the Jetson and watch `arduino-cli monitor` to confirm a steady stream of `dispatch` events.
- Tweak `steps_per_deg` in `configs/robot.yaml` if the 3200 microstep assumption drifts, then re-enable laser firing and validate pulse timing at the DM556 inputs.
